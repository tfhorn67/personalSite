Are you reading this? Wow. Since you're here, here are some cool nerdy things I
was involved with in college that I'm pretty proud of but aren't directly
relevant to my professional trajectory.

tl;dr: Hovercraft, composites & materials science are cool. NASA. Carbon Fiber.
Also Roll Tide. Aubs eat boogs.

I helped build this monster. My friend Graham crashed and damaged it on a pylon
while in open water during the race because he's a crazy aggressive driver who
is as much a racer as an engineer. He got it going again and still locked down
that win. Nice going, Graham. We're proud of you and we're glad you were okay.

I spent something like three years helping Will Guin build and test carbon
nanotube (CNTs) impregnated carbon fiber composites under the supervision of
Dr. Jialai Wang as part of a NASA funded research project to examine the effects
of the CNTs on the tensile strength and delamination resistance of carbon fiber
composites built using the above technology. I made a great friend and I got to
work on a super neat project in a really nice lab with lots of very expensive
turbo-awesome and interesting equipment.
